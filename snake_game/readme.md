# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game provides a fun and challenging experience where the player controls a snake that must eat food while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

## Getting Started

To play the Snake Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you've stored the game files.

4. Run the game by executing the `main.py` file using Python:

   ```python main.py```

5. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction (Up, Down, Left, Right).

6. Try to eat the blue food dots to increase your score.

7. Avoid running into the walls or colliding with the snake's own body.

8. The game will display your current score, and it's game over if you collide or run out of bounds.
